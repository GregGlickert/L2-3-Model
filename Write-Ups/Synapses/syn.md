We are currently using all the of the synaptic parameters from Ziao's M1L5 model except for the GABA-A rev for the PN cell was alter. Currently we use -75mV for the reversal potential where Ziao had set his to -90mV.The measured reversal potential for GABAA-mediated IPSPs was –73 mV (Beierlein et al 2003) so we could alter to -73 but would most likely not have much of an effect compared to -75mV.
